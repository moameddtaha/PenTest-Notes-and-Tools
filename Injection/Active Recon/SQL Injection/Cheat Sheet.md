Note:
-   The reason for using `NULL` as the values returned from the injected `SELECT` query is that the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injected queries. Since `NULL` is convertible to every commonly used data type, using `NULL` maximizes the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct.
-   On Oracle, every `SELECT` query must use the `FROM` keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like:
    
    `' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--`
-   The payloads described use the double-dash comment sequence `--` to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. On MySQL, the double-dash sequence must be followed by a space. Alternatively, the hash character `#` can be used to identify a comment.
