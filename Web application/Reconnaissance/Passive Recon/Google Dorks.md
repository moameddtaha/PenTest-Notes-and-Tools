## How Google dorking works
___

Google dorking is a [passive attack](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-attack) or hacking method involving the use of a custom query. Hackers use Google to identify websites with security [vulnerabilities](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/vulnerability) and/or [sensitive information](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/sensitive-information) the attacker can use, usually for some malicious purpose.

Around since 2002, dorking usually involves using a [search engine](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/search-engine) as a hacking tool. Google's tremendous web crawling capabilities facilitate dorking. With a Google dork, attackers can access a lot of information they wouldn't be able to get with simple queries. This information includes the following:

-   usernames and [passwords](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/password)
-   [email](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/e-mail-electronic-mail-or-email) address lists
-   sensitive documents
-   personally identifiable information
-   personally identifiable financial information
-   website vulnerabilities

## Common Google dork operators
___

A search parameter in a Google dork is applied to a search on the search engine. Google has its own query language built in, and hackers use these queries to find sensitive files, track people and discover web vulnerabilities a simple search does not reveal.

Here are some popular search parameters often used in Google dorks.

|Operator | Function| Example|
|------------ | ------------|------------|
|cache: | Returns the cached version of a website| cache:techtarget.com|
|site: | Returns a list of all indexed [URLs](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/URL) from a website or domain| site:techtarget.com|
|filetype: | Returns various kinds of files, depending on the file extension provided| filetype:pdf|
|inurl: | Searches for a specific term in the URL| inurl:admin|
|allinurl: | Returns results whose URL contains all the specified characters| allinurl:clientarea|
|intext: | Locates webpages that contain certain characters or strings inside their text| intext:"Google Dork Query"|
|inanchor: | Searches for an exact anchor text used on any links| inanchor:"cyber attacks"|
| Operator (OR) | hacking (OR) Google dork| show the help message and exit|
| + | Concatenates words to detect pages using more than one specific key| hacking + Google dork|
| - | Used to avoid displaying results containing certain words| hacking - dork|


## Examples
___

Search for subdomains

```copy
site:*.stackoverflow.com
```

Search for subdomains that have admin in their URL

```copy
site:*.stackoverflow.com inurl:admin
```

To limit all the results to subdomain with admin within the actual site title

```copy
site:*.stackoverflow.com intitle:admin
```

Seearch for employees in stackoverflow

```copy
site:stackoverflow.com employees
```

Search for older version on a website (maybe months ago), It will display google web cache.

```copy
cache:ine.com
```

### Important

 If we looking for sites with directory listing enabled, we can use the `intitle` search filter and specify that within the title, we are looking for `index of` 

```copy
intitle: index of
```

This is a common <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">vulnrability</mark> within web servers so if you familiar with how the web servers work, there is a misconfiguration (it's not realy a misconfiguration) called directory listing, you realy rarley want to have this open or running on a production site.

The reason for that is because it allows users to view the contents of that directory.
