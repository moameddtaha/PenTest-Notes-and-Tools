┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ host google.com
google.com has address 142.250.201.14
google.com has IPv6 address 2a00:1450:4006:80e::200e
google.com mail is handled by 10 smtp.google.com.
```

As you can see this performing a DNS lookup.

As you can see beside getting the IP address we also get the actual mail server 
```
google.com mail is handled by 10 smtp.google.com.
```
and it provides us with the actual domain for that webserver
```
smtp.google.com.
```

```
[^Note]:
	If you ever see 2 IPs just know from that point you are dealing with some 
	form of proxy (ex, cloudflare which is firewall / proxy).
```
