# Overview

DAVTest is a tool used to test WebDAV enabled servers. It is written in Python and allows for easy testing of various aspects of a WebDAV server, including basic functionality, security configurations, and support for various protocols and extensions.

# Examples

I first run Nmap with script http-enum to get WebDAV directory

```ruby
nmap -sV --script http-enum 10.4.16.103 -p 80
```
