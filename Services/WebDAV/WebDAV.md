# Overview

WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a protocol that allows for the collaboration and editing of files on a remote server. It is built on top of the HTTP protocol, which makes it compatible with the existing infrastructure used for the World Wide Web. WebDAV enables users to edit and manage files (update, delete, move and copy) on a remote server, just as if they were stored on their local computer.

Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is a popular web server software that supports WebDAV. IIS can be configured to act as a WebDAV server, allowing clients to access and modify files stored on the IIS server using WebDAV protocols. This provides a convenient way for users to access and manage files on the server, as well as collaborate with others, regardless of their physical location. Additionally, IIS also provides support for WebDAV clients, allowing users to access and modify files stored on a remote WebDAV server using IIS as the client.

# Features

One of the key features of WebDAV is that it allows multiple users to access and edit the same file simultaneously, making it ideal for collaboration and teamwork. It also supports versioning, which means that previous versions of a file can be stored and retrieved at a later time, providing a valuable tool for tracking changes and preserving important data.

# Ports

WebDAV operates over **TCP** port **80** and **443**, which are the standard ports used for HTTP and HTTPS respectively. This makes it easy to deploy and integrate with existing web infrastructure, as these ports are commonly open on most firewalls and network configurations.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, WebDAV is a versatile and powerful protocol that provides a convenient and secure way for users to manage and collaborate on files stored on a remote server. Its compatibility with existing web infrastructure, along with its support for versioning, makes it a popular choice for businesses and organizations looking to improve their file management processes. IIS is just one example of a popular web server software that supports WebDAV, providing an easy and integrated way for users to access and manage their files.
