# Overview

SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block Protocol) is a network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals between computers on a local network (LAN). It was originally designed to run on top of NETBIOS in older Windows systems, but now operates directly over TCP/IP.

# Ports

The SMB protocol operates on **TCP** port **445**, and allows clients to request file and print services from a server, as well as other operations such as remote procedure calls (RPCs) and remote administration.

# Features

In addition to its original use for file and print sharing, SMB has been extended and improved over the years to support a variety of other services and features, including file and printer security, transparent failover, and the ability to access remote files as if they were local.

# Conclusion

SMB is a critical protocol for many organizations and is widely used for sharing files and printers in Windows-based networks. It is important to understand the basic principles and capabilities of SMB in order to effectively manage and secure network file sharing.
