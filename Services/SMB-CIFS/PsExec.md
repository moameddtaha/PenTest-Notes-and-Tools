# Overview

PsExec is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to remotely execute commands on other computers over a network. It is commonly used by IT administrators to manage and troubleshoot remote systems, but it can also be leveraged by hackers to gain unauthorized access to target networks. PsExec uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for authentication and communication.

# Metasploit

One way to leverage PsExec for malicious purposes is by using the "exploit/windows/smb/psexec" module in the Metasploit framework. This module enables an attacker to gain a meterpreter shell and remotely execute arbitrary commands on a target system.

# Examples

To use PsExec on Linux, you can use the psexec.py script, which is a Python-based implementation of PsExec. Here is an example command:

```bash
psexec.py <USERNAME>@<IP> <COMMAND>
```

Replace `<USERNAME>` and `<IP>` with the appropriate values for your target. `<COMMAND>` is the command you want to execute remotely.

```bash
psexec.py 10.10.2.5 cmd.exe
```
