## Nmap: Network Scanning Tool

Nmap is a powerful network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery, service and operating system detection, and scripting capabilities.

## Usage
___

### Scan Techniques

-   TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans: `-sS`, `-sT`, `-sA`, `-sW`, `-sM`
-   UDP Scan: `-sU`

### Service/Version Detection

-   Probe open ports to determine service/version info: `-sV`

### Host Discovery

-   Ping Scan: `-sn` (disable port scan)
-   Treat all hosts as online: `-Pn` (skip host discovery, disable ping scan)

### Port Specification and Scan Order

-   Scan specified ports only: `-p (port range)`
-   Scan fewer ports than the default: `-F`

### Script Scan

-   Default script scan: `-sC`

### Misc

-   Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute: `-A`

### OS Detection

-   Enable OS detection: `-O`
-   Limit OS detection to promising targets: `--osscan-limit`
-   Guess OS more aggressively: `--osscan-guess`

### Output

-   Output scan in normal format: `-oN`
-   Output scan in XML format: `-oX`
-   Output scan in script kiddie format: `-oS`
-   Output scan in Grepable format: `-oG <file>`

### Timing and Performance

-   Set timing template: `-T<0-5>`
-   Timing templates: paranoid, sneaky, polite, normal, aggressive, insane

### Verbosity and debugging options

-   Show the reason each port is set to a specific state and the reason each host is up or down: `--reason`
