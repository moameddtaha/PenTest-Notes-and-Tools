# Overview

arp-scan is a useful command-line tool for network administrators. It allows you to discover and identify IP hosts on your local network by using the ARP protocol.

## ARP Protocol

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol that maps an IP address to a physical (MAC) address on a local network. It is used by devices to determine the hardware address of another device in the same network in order to communicate with it.

When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it first needs to determine the hardware address (MAC address) of the destination device. This is done by sending an ARP request that broadcasts to all devices on the network, asking for the MAC address of the device with a certain IP address. The device with that IP address will then respond with its MAC address, allowing the sending device to communicate directly with it using its MAC address.

ARP is an important protocol for the functioning of local networks, as it allows devices to communicate with each other by mapping IP addresses to hardware addresses.

# Usage

arp-scan has several options that you can use to customize your scan. Here are two of the most commonly used options:

-I (specify the interface)

`This option allows you to specify the network interface that arp-scan will use to scan the network. For example, you can specify eth0 if you want to scan the network connected to your Ethernet interface.`

-g, --generate (generate target list)

`This option allows you to specify the target IP addresses that arp-scan will scan. You can provide a range of IP addresses by specifying the start and end IP, or you can provide a CIDR address. For example:`

# Examples

```ruby
sudo arp-scan -I eth0 -g <IP/Range>
```
