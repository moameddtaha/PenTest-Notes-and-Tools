All configuration files for Nginx virtual hosts are stored in the 
```ruby
/etc/nginx/sites-available/folder
```
The best way is to create a separate file for each web site on the server.

we can use this path 
```ruby
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
to get wordpress config file path from nginx server.
