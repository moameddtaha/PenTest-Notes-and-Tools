# Overview

`ufw` stands for Uncomplicated Firewall, and it is a front-end to the built-in netfilter firewall in Linux. It is designed to make it easy to configure a firewall on a Linux system without requiring extensive knowledge of the underlying [[iptables]] system.

`ufw` provides a user-friendly command-line interface to manage firewall rules. It can be used to configure rules to allow or deny incoming and outgoing network traffic based on criteria such as the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

# Example

Here are some common `ufw` commands and their functions:

-   `sudo ufw enable`: Enables the firewall and turns on the default set of rules.
-   `sudo ufw disable`: Disables the firewall and allows all incoming and outgoing traffic.
-   `sudo ufw status`: Displays the current status of the firewall and the list of rules.
-   `sudo ufw allow <port>/<protocol>`: Allows incoming traffic on a specific port and protocol.
-   `sudo ufw deny <port>/<protocol>`: Blocks incoming traffic on a specific port and protocol.
-   `sudo ufw allow from <ip_address>`: Allows incoming traffic from a specific IP address.
-   `sudo ufw deny from <ip_address>`: Blocks incoming traffic from a specific IP address.

By default, `ufw` blocks all incoming traffic and allows all outgoing traffic. You can configure `ufw` rules to customize the firewall behavior and protect your system from unauthorized access. Note that `ufw` is just a front-end to iptables, so you can still use iptables commands directly if you need more advanced firewall functionality.
