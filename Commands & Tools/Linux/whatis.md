If you want to learn more about command on linux you can always utalize the
```
whatis
```
and then type the name of the command.

Ex:
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ whatis host                                                                                  
host (1)             - DNS lookup utility
```

As you can see this is a DNS lookup utility.
