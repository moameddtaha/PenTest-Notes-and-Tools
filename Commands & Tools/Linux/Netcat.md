## About

Netcat, also known as the "TCP/IP swiss army knife", is a versatile command-line tool that can be used for a variety of purposes including port scanning, file transfers, and network testing. It can be used as both a client and a server, making it a powerful tool for network communication.

## Usage

-   **Network Communication**: Netcat can be used to establish a connection to a remote host and send data over it. The syntax for this is `nc [options] host port`. For example, to connect to a remote host on port 80, the command would be `nc host.com 80`.
    
-   **Port Scanning**: Netcat can be used to scan for open ports on a remote host. This can be done by specifying the `-z` option, followed by the host and port range. For example, to scan for open ports on host.com from port 1 to 100, the command would be `nc -z host.com 1-100`.
    
-   **File Transfers**: Netcat can be used to transfer files between computers. To do this, you can use the `-l` option on the receiving computer to listen for a connection, and then use the `-w` option on the sending computer to specify a timeout. The syntax for this is `nc -l -p port > file.txt` on the receiving computer, and `nc host port < file.txt` on the sending computer.
    
-   **Backdoors**: Netcat can be used to create a simple backdoor on a remote host. This can be done by specifying the `-l` option on the remote host to listen for a connection, and then connecting to it from the attacker's machine. The syntax for this is `nc -l -p port` on the remote host, and `nc host port` on the attacker's machine.

## Options

-   `-l` - This option is used to listen for incoming connections.
-   `-p` - This option is used to specify a source port.
-   `-v` - This option is used to display verbose output.
-   `-w` - This option is used to specify a timeout for connections.

## Examples

-   Listen on port 80 and display incoming connections: 

	```ruby
	nc -lvnp 80
	```

-   Connect to a remote host on specific port: 

	```ruby
	nc <hostname or IP> <PORT>
	```

- Fetch the banner and check the version of SSH server

	```ruby
	nc <hostname or IP>
	```
