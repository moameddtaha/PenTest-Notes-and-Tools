## Overview

Browsh is a modern, text-based web browser that uses the Chrome/Chromium engine to render web pages and provides a terminal interface for browsing the web. It allows users to browse the web in a terminal window, which can be useful for those who prefer to use a terminal-based workflow or for those who have limited resources (e.g. low-end hardware or slow internet connection).

## Options

-   --no-sandbox: Disable the sandbox mode
-   --disable-gpu: Disable GPU acceleration
-   --disable-dev-shm-usage: Disable the use of /dev/shm for shared memory
