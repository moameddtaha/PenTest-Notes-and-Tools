The `net use` command is a command-line tool in Windows that **allows you to connect to, remove, and configure connections to network resources.** The `net use` command can be used to connect to shared resources on a network, such as a shared folder or printer. It can also be used to disconnect from these resources and to configure various options related to these connections.

Here are some examples of how you can use the `net use` command:

-   To connect to a shared folder on a networked computer, you can use a command like this:

	Enter the PASS and USER if there is.

```
net use z: \\computer\sharedfolder <PASS> /user:<USER>
```

This will connect to the shared folder on the networked computer and assign it a drive letter (in this case, Z:) on your local computer.

-   To disconnect from a shared resource, you can use a command like this:

```
net use z: /delete
```

This will delete the connection to the shared resource and free up the drive letter.

-   To view a list of current connections to network resources, you can use the `net use` command with no options:

```
net use
```

This will display a list of all the connections to network resources on your computer.
