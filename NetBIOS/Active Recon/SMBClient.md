# SMBClient

`smbclient` is a command-line tool that allows accessing and managing SMB shares on a network, using the SMB protocol built on top of the NetBIOS protocol. It allows connecting to SMB shares, listing and transferring files, and creating and deleting directories. It can be used by penetration testers to access network shares and gather sensitive information, and by system administrators to transfer files and manage shares. It should be used with caution in compliance with security policies.

## Features

-   Discover SMB devices on your network
-   List file shares
-   List/create/delete directories
-   Read file meta data
-   Read/write/delete files
-   Seek/read partial

## Options

- **-L**: Get a list of shares available on a host
- **-W**: Set the workgroup name
- **-U**: Set the network username
- **-N**: --no-pass (Don't ask for a password).

## Examples

-   To get a list of shares available on a host with IP address 10.0.0.1, use the following command:

	```ruby
	smbclient -L <IP>
	```

-   To set the workgroup name to "Workgroup" and the network username to "user", use the following command:

	```ruby
	smbclient -W Workgroup -U user
	```


-   To connect to an SMB server at IP address 10.0.0.1 without prompting for a password, use the following command:

	```ruby
	smbclient -N <IP>
	```

### Connection

- Connect to share with no password

	```ruby
	smbclient //<IP>/<share> -N
	```
