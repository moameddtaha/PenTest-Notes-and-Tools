## About

Fierce is a `DNS` reconnaissance tool for locating non-contiguous IP space.

	Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous IP 
	space and hostnames against specified domains. It's really meant as a pre- 
	cursor to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all of those 
	require that you already know what IP space you are looking for. This does 
	not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole internet 
	indiscriminately. It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both 
	inside and outside a corporate network. Because it uses DNS primarily you 
	will often find mis-configured networks that leak internal address space. 
	That's especially useful in targeted malware.


## Using

Let's start with something basic:

```
$ fierce --domain google.com --subdomains accounts admin ads
```

Traverse IPs near discovered domains to search for contiguous blocks with the `--traverse` flag:

```
$ fierce --domain facebook.com --subdomains admin --traverse 10
```

Limit nearby IP traversal to certain domains with the `--search` flag:

```
$ fierce --domain facebook.com --subdomains admin --search fb.com fb.net
```

Attempt an `HTTP` connection on domains discovered with the `--connect` flag:

```
$ fierce --domain stackoverflow.com --subdomains mail --connect
```

Exchange speed for breadth with the `--wide` flag, which looks for nearby domains on all IPs of the [/24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks) of a discovered domain:

```
$ fierce --domain facebook.com --wide
```

#Zone-transfers are rare these days, but they give us the keys to the DNS castle. [zonetransfer.me](https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php) is a very useful service for testing for and learning about zone transfers:

```
$ fierce --domain zonetransfer.me
```

To save the results to a file for later use we can simply redirect output:

```
$ fierce --domain zonetransfer.me > output.txt
```

Internal networks will often have large blocks of contiguous IP space assigned. We can scan those as well:

```
$ fierce --dns-servers 10.0.0.1 --range 10.0.0.0/24
```
