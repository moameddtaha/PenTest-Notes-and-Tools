# dnsenum

## About

Dnsenum is a powerful, multithreaded Perl script that can be used to enumerate DNS information of a domain and discover non-contiguous IP blocks. With dnsenum, you can quickly and easily gather a wide range of information about a domain, including:

-   Host addresses (A records)
-   Nameservers (threaded)
-   MX records (threaded)
-   BIND version (threaded)
-   Extra names and subdomains via Google scraping
-   Brute force subdomains from a file
-   C class domain network ranges
-   Whois queries on network ranges (threaded)
-   Reverse lookups on network ranges (threaded)
-   Writing to a domain_ips.txt file with IP blocks

## Usage

Performing DNS zone transfers automatically is one of the key features of dnsenum. Zone-transfers are rare these days, but they can give you the keys to the DNS castle. [zonetransfer.me](https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php) is a very useful service for testing for and learning about zone transfers. To use dnsenum to perform a zone transfer, simply run the following command:

```ruby
dnsenum zonetransfer.me
```

You can also use dnsenum to perform a full enumeration of a domain by running the command:

```ruby
dnsenum example.com
```

This command will gather all the information listed above for the domain example.com and save it to a file named example.com_ips.txt.

You can also specify a list of nameservers to use instead of discovering them during the enumeration by using the `-n` option:

```ruby
dnsenum example.com -n 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

Additionally, you can specify a list of subdomains to brute force using the `-f` option:

```ruby
dnsenum example.com -f subdomains.txt
```
