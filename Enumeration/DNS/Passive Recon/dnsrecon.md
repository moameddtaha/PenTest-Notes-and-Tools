### Explenation

1. As you can see 'DNSSEC is not configured' so it reveals the actual IP of the DNS, 

2. you can see also, the mail server (MS) and there using google mail server 'MX ASPMX5.GOOGLEMAIL.COM'

3. the website IP which is '5.196.105.14' 

4. the TXT record which are essentially used for diagnostic information and in this case i't google site verification TXT record is typically used whenever you want to track a website's analytics with google they will typically tell you to add a TXT DNS record and add the following information so in this case it's the domain name itself and then the actual TXT record 'TXT zoneTransfer.me google-site verification=tyP28J7JAUHA9fw2sHXMgcCC0I6XBmmoVi04VlMewxA'
