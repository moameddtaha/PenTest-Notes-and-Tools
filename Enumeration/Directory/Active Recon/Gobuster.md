## About
___

Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force:

-   URIs (directories and files) in web sites.
-   DNS subdomains (with wildcard support).
-   Virtual Host names on target web servers.
-   Open Amazon S3 buckets
-   Open Google Cloud buckets
-   TFTP servers

## Usage
___

### Subdomains
___

To enumerate subdomains using the GoBuster tool, you can use the `dns` subcommand and specify the domain you want to enumerate subdomains for as an argument. For example:

```
gobuster dns -d example.com -w wordlist.txt
```

This would tell GoBuster to enumerate subdomains for the `example.com` domain using the wordlist specified in the `wordlist.txt` file.

You can also use the `-vhost` option to specify a virtual host (VHOST) to use for the subdomain enumeration. This can be useful if the web server uses VHOSTs to host multiple websites on a single IP address. For example:

```
gobuster vhost -u https://mysite.com -w common-vhosts.txt
```

This would tell GoBuster to enumerate subdomains for the `example.com` VHOST using the wordlist specified in the `wordlist.txt` file.

By default, GoBuster uses the `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, and `TXT` record types to enumerate subdomains. You can use the `-t` option to specify a different record type, or you can use the `-t ALL` option **to use all available record types.**

The `gobuster dns` command is useful for discovering subdomains of a particular domain or VHOST that may not be listed in public DNS records. It can be used as part of a broader enumeration or reconnaissance effort to identify potential targets for further analysis or attack.
