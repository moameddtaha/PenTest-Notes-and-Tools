# rpcclient

`rpcclient` is a command-line tool used to interact with Microsoft Windows systems and servers that have the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service enabled and the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol enabled. It allows performing tasks such as querying system information, managing users and groups, interacting with the system's security features, listing shares, and executing commands on the remote system. It is a client application that uses the SMB protocol to communicate with Windows systems. It should be used with caution and in compliance with security policies by both penetration testers and system administrators for remote management of Windows systems.
