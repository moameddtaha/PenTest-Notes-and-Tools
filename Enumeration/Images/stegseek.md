# Overview
___

Stegseek is a lightning fast steghide cracker that can be used to extract hidden data from files. It is built as a fork of the original steghide project and, as a result, it is _thousands of times_ faster than other crackers and can run through the entirety of `rockyou.txt` **in under 2 seconds.**

Stegseek can also be used to extract steghide metadata without a password, which can be used to test whether a file contains steghide data.

## Usage
___

The most important feature of stegseek is wordlist cracking:

```
stegseek [stegofile.jpg] [wordlist.txt]
```

This mode will simply try all passwords in the provided wordlist against the provided stegofile.

### Detection and passwordless extraction (CVE-2021-27211)

Stegseek can also be used to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">detect</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extract</mark> any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unencrypted</mark> (meta) data from a steghide image. This exploits the fact that the random number generator used in steghide only has 2^32 possible seeds, which can be bruteforced in a matter of minutes.

```
stegseek --seed [stegofile.jpg]
```

This command will tell you:

-   Whether this file actually contains steghide content.
-   How much hidden content the file contains.
-   How the content was encrypted .

If you're (very) lucky and the file was encoded without encryption, this mode will even recover the encoded file for you!
