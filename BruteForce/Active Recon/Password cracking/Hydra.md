## About

Hydra is a command-line tool that helps penetration testers and ethical hackers crack the passwords of network services. Hydra can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols, including telnet, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, databases, and several other services.

Hydra is a fast, parallelized, network authentication cracker that supports different protocols. It can attack nearly fifty different service types, including **Cisco auth**, **FTP**, **HTTP**, **IMAP**, **RDP**, **SMB**, **SSH**, and **Telnet**. The tool can use dictionaries of usernames or passwords and can also perform pure brute-force password attacks. Hydra's architecture is based on modules, which are pieces of code that let Hydra attack a specific protocol. However, it should be noted that the use of the Hydra tool should only be done in the context of penetration testing or ethical hacking, and not for any illegal activities.

## Options

- **-p**: Single password (Small).
- **-P**: Password file (Capital).
- **-l**: Single username (Small).
- **-L**: Username file (Capital).
- **-U**: Get information about a module.

## Examples

-   To get information about a module:

	```ruby
	hydra -U rdp
	```

## Services

- Bruteforce service specifying username and password file.

```ruby
hydra -l <USER> -P <PASS FILE> <IP> <service types>
```

### MySQL

- To perform a dictionary attack against a MySQL service, you can use the following command:

	```ruby
	sudo hydra -L <usernames list> -P <password lists> <IP> mysql
	```

	This command uses a list of usernames and passwords to try and login to a MySQL service on the specified IP address.

### Websites

- To perform a dictionary attack against a page authentication 

```ruby
sudo hydra -l <username> -P <Wordlist> <IP> <HTTP method> <Page>
```

- To perform a dictionary attack against a website's login form, you can use the following command:

	```ruby
	sudo hydra -l <username> -P <Wordlist> <IP> <HTTP method> "<Page>:username=<username>&password=^PASS^:F=<Invalid Password!>" OR :S=<success login>
	```

	This command uses a single username and password list to try and login to a website on the specified IP address and HTTP method (GET or POST). The `<Page>` argument should be replaced with the URL of the login page. The `F=<Invalid Password!>` argument tells Hydra to look for the string "Invalid Password!" on the page to determine if the login was unsuccessful. The `S=<success login>` argument tells Hydra to look for the string "success login" on the page to determine if the login was successful.

#### Example:

- POST:

	```ruby
	sudo hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.10.43 http-post-form "/department/login.php:username=admin&password=^PASS^:F=Invalid Password!"
	```

	This command uses the "admin" username and the "rockyou.txt" password list to try and login to the login page of a website on the IP address 10.10.10.43 using the HTTP POST method.

- GET:

	```ruby
	sudo hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Shoppy.htb http-get-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Wrong Credentials"
	```


	This command uses the "rockyou.txt" username and password lists to try and login to the login page of a website on the domain "Shoppy.htb" using the HTTP GET method.
