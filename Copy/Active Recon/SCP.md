# SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)

## About:

SCP is a network protocol used to securely copy files/folders between Linux (Unix) systems on a network. It uses the `scp` command line utility which is a safer variant of the `cp` command. SCP encrypts the files and passwords being transferred over an SSH connection, ensuring that even if the traffic is intercepted, the information is still protected.

## Use Cases:

-   Copying files from a local host to a remote host (vise versa).
-   Copying files between two remote servers.

## Options:

-   `-r` : Copies directories recursively

	It means that it will copy the contents of the directory and all its subdirectories within it. It preserves the directory structure of the source directory in the destination directory. This option is useful when you want to copy an entire directory and all its contents, including subdirectories and files, to a different location.

-   `-p` : Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file
-   `-q` : Quiet mode, disables the progress meter and warning messages
-   `-v` : Verbose mode, shows the progress of the transfer
-   `-C` : Enables compression during the transfer

## Command Syntax:

```ruby
scp [options] [user_name@source_host:path/to/source/file] [user_name@target_host:target/path] 
```

## Examples:

-   Copying files from remote host to local host:

```ruby
scp user_name@source_host:path/to/source/file path
```

```ruby
scp 147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir/sample_example.txt home/Desktop
```

-   Copying files from local host to remote host:

```ruby
scp path/to/source/file user_name@target_host:target/path
```

```ruby
scp Desktop/sample_example.txt root@136.183.142.28:/home/remote_dir
```

-   Copy a File from One Remote Server to Another

```ruby
scp root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir/sample_example.txt sofija@146.153.129.25:home/Desktop
```

-   Copy Multiple Files with SCP

	SCP allows you to copy multiple files in a single command. For example, the command below copies two files from a local host to a remote server:

```ruby
scp example/sample1.txt example/sample2.txt root@147.182.143.27:/home/remote_dir
```
